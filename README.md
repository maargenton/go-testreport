---------------------------

## Usage

```
go install github.com/margenton/go-testreport

go-testreport --race ./... -oyaml=test-report.yaml -omarkdown.tmpl=test-report.md

go run github.com/maargenton/go-testreport@latest --race ./... -omd=test-report.md
```

The input can be:
- a json file generated by `go test -json`
- a yaml file generated by a prior invocation
- a go package reference, similar to the argument to `go test`, in which case
  `go test` is invoked and its output captured.

The output format can be specified as:
- `yaml`: produces a YAML file containing a straight representation of the
  internal model.
- `markdown`: produces a markdown report from a built-in template. The output
  list all the packages with coverage, and all the tests, passed or failed.
  Failure details are also included in the report.
- `markdown-summary`: produces an alternate markdown report, tailored toward
  build summary, focussing on package-level summary and individual failures. The
  full report is also included in a collapsed section that can be expanded if
  needed.
- a custom template filename (see [Using Custom
Template](#using-custom-template))

### Sample output

github.com/maargenton/go-cli/pkg/cli

Coverage: 100%

- ❌ TestGetCompletion
  - ❌ Given an configured OptionSet
    - ✅ when calling GetCompletion() with no arguments
      - ✅ then no specific option is being completed
      - ✅ then the first argument is being completed
      - ✅ then available options are listed
    - ✅ when calling GetCompletion() with flag expecting a value
      - ✅ then only yhe option is returned
    - ❌ when calling GetCompletion() with flag and value
      - ❌ then remaining options are listed
        ```
        completion_test.go:71:
            expected:       set(value.Option) == []string{ "--format <value>", "-v" }
            value:          []option.Description{
                            	option.Description{
                            		Option:      "--forfmat <value>",
                            		Description: "communcation format, e.g. 8N1",
                            	},
                            	option.Description{
                            		Option:      "-v",
                            		Description: "display additional information on startup",
                            	},
                            }
            $.Option:       { "--forfmat <value>", "-v" }
            extra values:   "--forfmat <value>"
            missing values: "--format <value>"
        ```
      - ✅ then the first argument is being completed



## Using Custom Template

`go-testreport` can also produce output from a custom template file, based on
standard [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). The template is
applied to the list of packages stored in the internal model, generated from
parsing the test results.

```
go-testreport ./... -otemplate/my_template.tmpl=build/my-build-report.yaml
```

### Package

- `{{ .Name }}`: The name of the package
- `{{ Elapsed }}`: The time taken to run the tests
-	`{{Passed}}`: The number of leaf tests that passed
-	`{{Failed}}`: The number of leaf tests that failed
- `{{ Coverage }}`: A percentage value (0..100) of how much of the code is
  exercised by the tests running within the package.
- `{{ Skipped }}`: A boolean value that is `true` if the tests for that package
  have been skipped; usually when there is no test in the package
- `{{ Tests }}`: A list of `Test` objects containing the top level tests of the
  package. Those tests might include nested tests.
- `{{ LeafTests }}`: A list of `Test` objects containing all the leaf tests in
  the package, i.e. all the tests in the test hierarchy that do not contain any
  more nested tests. Those tests are usually the meaningful ones -- the ones
  that evaluate and verify some assertions that might cause a failure.


### Test

- `{{ .Name }}`: The name of the test
- `{{ .FullName }}`: The full name of the test including its name and the name
  of all its `Parent` tests, joined by a ', ' (comma + space).
- `{{ .PartialName <n> }}`: Same as `FullName`, but excluding `n` test names
  from the top of the hierarchy. Using n = 1 skips the top level test name (the
  name of the test function), which is usually formatted differently from the
  rest because it has to be a valid function name, starting with `Test`.
- `{{ .Failure }}`: A boolean value that is `true` if the test was a failure.
- `{{ .Output }}`: A list of strings containing the output of the test, one
  string per line. Common white space prefix and all white spaces suffix are
  stripped.
- `{{ .Parent }}`: A reference back to the parent test if any, or nil for
  package level tests.
- `{{ .Tests }}`: The list of nested tests.
- `{{ .LeafTests }}`: The list of all the tests in the hierarchy of the current
  test that do not contain any more nested tests.

### Custom template function

- `render`: is similar to the built-in `template` function that applies a
  partial template to an object. `render` actually renders the template and
  produces a multi-line string containing the result.
  ```
  {{- render "test" . -}}
  ```
- `indent`: applies the specified number of indentation spaces to a multi-line
  string, shifting the whole content to the right. Note that `indent` does not
  work with the built-in `template` function; it has be used with `render`
  instead.
  ```
  {{- render "test" . | indent 2 -}}
  ```

### Sample template

For reference, the template below is equivalent to the built-in template used to
produce the default markdown output.

```tmpl
# Test report

{{ range . -}}
{{- template "package" . -}}
{{- end }}


{{- define "package" -}}
{{-   if gt (len .Tests) 0 }}

## {{ .Name }}

Coverage: {{ .Coverage }}%
{{      range .Tests -}}
{{-       render "test" . -}}
{{-     end }}
{{    end -}}
{{- end -}}


{{- define "test" }}
- {{ render "outcome" . }} {{ .Name }}
{{-   render "output" . | indent 2 -}}
{{-   range .Tests -}}
{{-     render "test" . | indent 2 -}}
{{-   end -}}
{{- end -}}


{{- define "outcome" }}
{{-   if .Failure -}}❌{{- else -}}✅{{- end -}}
{{- end -}}


{{- define "output" }}
{{-   if gt (len .Output) 0 }}
        ```
{{      range .Output }}
{{        .  }}
{{-     end }}
        ```
{{-   end -}}
{{- end -}}
```
